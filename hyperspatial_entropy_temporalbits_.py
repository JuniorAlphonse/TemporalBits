# Exploration of Entropy in Hyperspatial Vaccum(s)

# Q1: Is The Second Law of Thermodyanmics is mandatory for "superpentaspaces" (such that dimensionalities are a total of five or more spacetime usually with 3 or more spatial dimensions, with at least one, but preferably, three or more time dimensions) or do different laws apply to manifolds and therefore spatial dimension cappers, as well as temporal dimensional cappers?

#Q2: Is pi, the possibility of safety in measuring the usage of the sun to determine time left before the natural logarithm of of the danger of the night sky of the enemy of the Homo Sapiens Sapiens as the Ancient philosophers Archimedes, Euclid, Socrates, Plato, and Ada Lovelace.
